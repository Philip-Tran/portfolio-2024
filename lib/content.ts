      "I've been learning Spanish over the past months and I love learning languages in general. Reading is a must if you want to grow your lexicon and being able to produce in the language you are learning in a holistic way latter on. But reading in the language we are learning is not always smooth, some time the context doesn't help you to understand the word you don't know, but if you are reading the book that doesn't have words that you don't know It's not a good book, to use to learning language at least. So I decided to create my own solution and this app is it. It's still in early stage, but it does the job and I'm happy with it, know I'm using it to learn Spanish almost everyday",
